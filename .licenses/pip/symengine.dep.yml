    2 is a complete rewrite of the FLINT library from scratch. It includes\nmuch cleaner
    code and in many cases much faster algorithms and implementations.\n\nAt this
    stage FLINT consists mainly of fast integer and polynomial\narithmetic and linear
    algebra. In the future it is planned that FLINT will\ncontain algorithms for algebraic
    number theory and other number theoretic\nfunctionality.\n\nWilliam Hart -- 16

    pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n
    \   The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to\n\n    provide a quality
    and complete implementation of the POSIX\n\n    threads API for Microsoft Windows
    within the limits imposed\n\n    by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and
    not\n\n    linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For\n\n    example,
    some functions and features, such as those based\n\n    on POSIX signals, are
    missing.\n\n\n    Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different\n\n
    \   versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used\n\n    as a dynamically
    linked module or a statically linked set of\n\n    binary modules. It is not an
    application on it's own.\n\n\n    It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be
    usable with\n\n    commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL\n\n
    \   licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's\n\n    code base, many
    of whom have done so because they have\n\n    used the library in commercial or
    proprietry software\n\n    projects.\n\n\n    Releasing pthreads-win32 under the
    LGPL ensures that the\n\n    library can be used widely, while at the same time
    ensures\n\n    that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code\n\n
    \   itself is returned to benefit all current and future users\n\n    of the library.\n\n\n
    \   Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications\n\n    that use
    POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the\n\n    broader goal of the
    project is to encourage the use of open\n\n    standards, and in particular, to
    make it just a little easier\n\n    for developers writing Win32 applications
    to consider\n\n    widening the potential market for their products.\n"
