    in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n

    retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute,
    all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the
    Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes

    Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
    that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    \         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
    if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or
    as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the
    License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated
    in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
    \     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
    the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\"
    BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
    \     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result
    of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
    even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
    \  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a
    fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
    obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
    such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n

    Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source
    Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute,
    must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the
    Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense,
    and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter
    or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution
    of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a)
    such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as
    described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable
    Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means
    in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to
    the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms
    of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n
    \   license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the
    recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution
    of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of
    Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License
    for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware
    with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software
    is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally
    distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s),
    so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute
    the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.
    Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including
    copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of
    liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except
    that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known
    factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose
    to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do
    so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make
    it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
    obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor
    for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity
    or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty
    and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to
    Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf
    it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order,
    or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the
    maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect.
    Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions
    of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
    statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient
    of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1.
    The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail
    to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights
    granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
    and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance
    by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.
    Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing
    basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
    means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with
    this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days
    after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against
    any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
    actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly
    or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and
    all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall
    terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above,
    all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave
    been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to
    termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*

    Limitation of Liability                                          *\n*  --------------------------

    \ Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *\n*  (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *\n*  Contributor, or
    anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *\n*  permitted above, be
    liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *\n*  special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character      *\n*  including, without limitation,
    damages for lost profits, loss of    *\n*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
    or malfunction, or any    *\n*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even
    if such party      *\n*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
    This   *\n*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
    \  *\n*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\n*
    \ extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\n*  jurisdictions
    do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\n*  incidental or consequential
    damages, so this exclusion and          *\n*  limitation may not apply to You.
