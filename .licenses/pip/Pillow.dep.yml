    version 1.0.8 of 13 July 2019\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n----\n\nFREETYPE2\n\nThe
    \ FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used\nlegally
    \ without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project\nusable  to
    a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two\nmutually exclusive
    open-source licenses.\n\nThis means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two
    licenses described\nbelow, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using
    FreeType 2 in\nany of your projects or products.\n\n  - The FreeType License,
    found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar\n    to the original BSD license
    *with* an advertising clause that forces\n    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType
    \ project  in your  product's\n    documentation.  All  details are in the license
    \ file.  This license\n    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU
    \ General  Public\n    License.\n\n    Note that  this license  is  compatible
    \ to the  GNU General  Public\n    License version 3, but not version 2.\n\n  -
    The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any\n    later
    version can be used  also), for programs which already use the\n    GPL.  Note
    \ that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its\n    advertisement
    clause.\n\nThe contributed BDF and PCF drivers  come with a license similar to
    that\nof the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see\nfile
    src/bdf/README and  src/pcf/README).  The same holds  for the files\n`fthash.c'
    and  `fthash.h'; their  code was  part of  the BDF  driver in\nearlier FreeType
    versions.\n\nThe gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which
    too is\ncompatible to the above two licenses.\n\nThe MD5 checksum support (only
    used for debugging in development builds)\nis in the public domain.\n\n\n----\n\nHARFBUZZ\n\nHarfBuzz
    is licensed under the so-called \"Old MIT\" license.  Details follow.\nFor parts
    of HarfBuzz that are licensed under different licenses see individual\nfiles names
    COPYING in subdirectories where applicable.\n\nCopyright © 2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020

    \   Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here\n    is
    a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\n    package (but
    check the individual files to be sure!):\n\n      - liblzma is in the public domain.\n\n
    \     - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\n        domain
    unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\n        in from the lib
    directory. The getopt_long code is under\n        GNU LGPLv2.1+.\n\n      - The
    scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\n        adapted from
    gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\n        under GNU GPLv2+.\n\n
    \     - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\n        XZ
    Utils specific documentation files in other directories\n        are in the public
    domain.\n\n      - Translated messages are in the public domain.\n\n      - The
    build system contains public domain files, and files that\n        are under GNU
    GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\n        in the binaries being
    built.\n\n      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\n
    \       utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\n\n      -
    The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\n        that are
    under various free software licenses.\n\n    You can do whatever you want with
    the files that have been put into\n    the public domain. If you find public domain
    legally problematic,\n    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you
    still find\n    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\n
    \   lawyers.\n\n    As usual, this software is provided \"as is\", without any
    warranty.\n\n    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ
    Utils\n    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\n
    \   polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\n    naturally
    it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\n    notice to put into
    \"about box\" or into documentation:\n\n        This software includes code from
    XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.\n\n    The following license texts are included
    in the following files:\n      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License
    version 2.1\n      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\n      -
    COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\n\n    Note that the toolchain
    (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\n    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus,
    it is possible that e.g. liblzma\n    binary wouldn't actually be in the public
    domain in its entirety\n    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the
    XZ Utils source\n    package.\n\n    If you have questions, don't hesitate to
    ask the author(s) for more\n    information.\n\n\n----\n\nLIBPNG\n\nCOPYRIGHT
