    # CC0 1.0 Universal

    ## Statement of Purpose

    The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
    exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
    subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
    authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).

    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
    purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
    (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
    infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
    redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
    including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
    to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
    production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
    greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
    others.

    For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
    additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
    Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
    and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
    publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
    Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
    effect of CC0 on those rights.

    1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
       protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
       Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
       to, the following:
       1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
          and translate a Work;
       2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
       3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
          depicted in a Work;
       4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
          subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
       5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
          a Work;
       6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
          European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
          protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
          including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
       7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
          based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
          thereof.

    2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
       applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
       unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
       and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
       known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
       action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
       duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
       extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
       copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
       commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
       makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
       to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
       such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
       termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
       enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
       Statement of Purpose.

    3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
       judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
       shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
       Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
       Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
       royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
       irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
       Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
       maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
       extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
       copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
       commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
       shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
       Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
       invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
       ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
       such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
       of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
       assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
       in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.

    4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
       1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
          surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
       2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
          of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
          otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
          the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
          absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
          extent permissible under applicable law.
       3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
          that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
          limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
          Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
          consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
       4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
          party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
          CC0 or use of the Work.
