        "In this notebook, we explored the usage of QURI VM for abstracting the architecture and devices of quantum computers. We have emphasized the intended modular usage of QURI VM and how algorithms should be written to support using arbitrary VM instances. We have also showed how to instance and use VMs for resource estimation. In summary, by following this notebook you will have learned how to\n",

        "- Perform sampling and expectation value estimation using the `sample()` and `estimate()` methods provided by the VM.\n",
        "- Write algorithms as functions that take a VM as an argument to separate the VM instance from the algorithm.\n",
        "- Evaluating the performance of quantum circuits on different architectures and devices using the `analyze()` method.\n",
